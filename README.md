# TechKG

## Introduction

[TechKG](http://www.techkg.cn/) is a large scale Chinese knowledge graph that is technology-oriented. It is built automatically from massive technical papers that are published in Chinese academic journals of different research domains.

[TechKG](http://www.techkg.cn/) can be served as the datasets of many diverse applications, such as knowledge graph embedding, relation extraction,knowledge based Q&A, text classification, machine translation, named entity recognition,etc.

In a word, [TechKG](http://www.techkg.cn/) is a Chinese Freebase or a Chinese YAGO!

## Experiments

To evaluate the adaptability of TechKG, we apply it to three completely different applications which are [KGE](https://github.com/MiskaChris/TechKG/tree/master/TechKGE), [distantly supervised RE](https://github.com/MiskaChris/TechKG/tree/master/TechRE) and [NER](https://github.com/MiskaChris/TechKG/tree/master/TechNER). For each of these applications, we select several of its state-of-the-art methods as baselines. We use them to conduct experiments on TechKG. It should be noted that the aim of our experiments is not to tell which model is better. On the contrary, we want to draw some conclusions that whether our TechKG could show some new characteristics hidden in KGs that havenâ€™t been noticed up to now.
